# Hetzner

 A cheap baseline infrastructure provider with governance seat in Europe that can be used to provision:
- Compute (Dedicated and Virtual servers)
- Networking (DNS, VPCs, Loadbalancers, IP Addresses)
- Persistence (Block Storage and Object Storage)

While supporting fewer of the higher level services than larger providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, Scaleway), they do so at a fraction of the cost (approx 1/5) and do support IaC provisioning through their APIs and SDKs.
